```
tokenDev = "your bot token here"

```
- Tweak the values in [config.json](https://github.com/YP501/frankie-bot/blob/main/src/config.json) to match the id's of your server

## Notes
- You are allowed to self-host this bot but you are not allowed to impersonate this bot as Frankie's bot.
- If you decide to self-host, keep in mind it only works in **one** server.
- You **MUST** credit the original author of this repository when self-hosting and **CANNOT** claim it as your own.
- This bot was previously named Helikopter Bot and was renamed to Scrappy Bot
