# Welcome to scrappy-bot!

**Steps on self-hosting:**
- Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/YP501/frankie-bot.git`
- Install the node modules with `yarn install`
- Add a .env file in the root folder with the following values:
```
tokenDev = "your bot token here"
dbAuthDev = "your mongo authentication uri here"
```
- Tweak the values in [config.json](https://github.com/YP501/frankie-bot/blob/main/src/config.json) to match the id's of your server
- Run `node main.js`
- You're done!

## Notes
- You are allowed to self-host this bot but you are not allowed to impersonate this bot as Frankie's bot.
- If you decide to self-host, keep in mind it only works for **one** server at a time.
- You **MUST** credit the original author of this repository when self-hosting and **cannot** claim it as your own.
- This bot was previously named Helikopter Bot and was renamed to Scrappy
