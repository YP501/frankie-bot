# Welcome to scrappy-bot, Frankie's Discord bot!
> Developed and maintained by [@YP501](https://github.com/YP501)

## Self-hosing
Self-hosting is allowed, although it's not recommended since this bot is focussed on the FrankieFmsLive server and will contain hardcoded values and is therefor likely to not work on other servers.
## Notes
- You are allowed to self-host this bot but you are not allowed to impersonate this bot as Frankie's bot.
- If you decide to self-host, keep in mind it only works in **one** server.
- You **MUST** credit the original author of this repository when self-hosting and **CANNOT** claim it as your own.
- This bot was previously named Helikopter Bot and was renamed to Scrappy Bot.
